### About

I am a Project Associate working in the RISE-IIL lab, under the guidance of [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I am currently working on a project in the area of Network Representation Learning.

### Academic Details

I completed my B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from SSN College of Engineering in the year 2017.

### Work Experience and Projects

- **Research Intern, RISE Lab, IIT Madras**  
I worked on end-to-end deep architectures for clustering of image data using Self-organizing Maps and Generative Models.

- **Control of Autonomous Quadrotor for Real-Time Object Tracking**  
For my final year project, our team built a quadrotor from scratch, and implemented Object Tracking (using Lucas-Kanade method) and Optical Image Stabilization of the camera footage (using Kalman Filter) to track and follow objects in front of it. 

### Extra-Curricular Activities

I am a playwright, and have been working on original scripts for public shows with Crea-Shakti and Lights Out Please. I was also involved in video editing and graphic design in my undergraduate days.

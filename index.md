### About

I am a Project Associate working in the RISE-IIL lab, under the guidance of [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I am currently working on a project in the area of Network Representation Learning.

### Academic Details

I completed my B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from SSN College of Engineering in the year 2017, with a CGPA of 8.45.

### Work Experience and Projects

- **Research Intern, RISE Lab, IIT Madras**  
I worked on end-to-end deep architectures for clustering of image data using Self-organizing Maps and Generative Models.

- **Control of Autonomous Quadrotor for Real-Time Object Tracking**  
For my final year project, our team built a quadrotor from scratch, and implemented Object Tracking (using Lucas-Kanade method) and Optical Image Stabilization of the camera footage (using Kalman Filter) to track and follow objects in front of it. Our controller was based on the APM (ArduPilot) stack.

### Extra-Curricular Activities

I am a playwright, and have been working on original scripts for public shows with Crea-Shakti and Lights Out Please. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBHO34u_u2g&feature=youtu.be) the video for the last show I did.  

I was involved in video editing and graphic design through my school and undergraduate days. [Here's](https://www.facebook.com/LightsOutPlease/videos/961480847296394/) a sample. I also love music and play a hodgepodge of instruments.
